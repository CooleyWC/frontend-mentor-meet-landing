## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was a challenge to have the avatar images extend slightly past the screen. Also on deskstop sizes, the hero content needed to,
split the left and right images. I initially tried to implement this with absolute positioning but found a working solution with
using grid and oversizing the item width.
